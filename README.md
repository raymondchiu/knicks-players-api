**Link to project:** [https://raymond-rapper-api-b82af4f2d15a.herokuapp.com/](https://knicks-players-api-4f6a9b1d5235.herokuapp.com/)

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express Framework

## Optimizations
Node Modules is included in .gitignore file, so run `npm install` in terminal after cloning or downloading the project to receive dependencies. 

## Lessons Learned:

The project wasn't running on my local machine, so I added CORS to allow for API to run on local system. I also added process.env in order to host on Heroku.

## Examples:
Take a look at Jalen Brunson's info!
