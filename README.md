## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, JavaScript, Node.js, Express Framework

## Optimizations
Node Modules file included in .gitignore file to reduce file size. You must run `npm install` in the terminal after cloning or downloading the project to receive project dependencies. 

## Lessons Learned:

The project wasn't running on my local machine, so I added `CORS` to allow for API to run on locally.

## Examples:
Take a look at Jalen Brunson's info!
